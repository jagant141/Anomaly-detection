# Anomalous User Behavior Detection 

A cloud-based **AI web application** that detects unusual or unauthorized user activities — such as abnormal logins or access behavior — using the **Isolation Forest algorithm**.  
This system combines **machine learning** and **Streamlit** for real-time anomaly detection and is fully **deployed on Streamlit Cloud**.

## 🧮 **Algorithm Used – Isolation Forest**

**Type:** Unsupervised Anomaly Detection  
**Concept:** Randomly isolates points; anomalies get isolated faster due to their rarity or distance from normal patterns.  

**Why Isolation Forest?**
- No need for labeled data  
- High performance on large datasets  
- Effective for behavioral and system log data
